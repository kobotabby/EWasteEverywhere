            <p>When e-waste is not recycled and burned or exposed to heat, toxic chemicals like dioxins are released into the air damaging the atmosphere. Poor management of e-waste can let it seep into groundwater impacting water quality and both land and sea animals. </p>

            <p>For a child, e-waste can change lung function, respiratory and respiratory effects and increases the risk of chronic diseases later in life, like cancer and cardiovascular disease. 12.9 million women are potentially exposed to toxic e-waste, working in the informal waste sector putting them and their unborn children at risk.</p>

                  <p class="quote">More than 18 million children and adolescents are actively engaged in the informal industrial sector. Most of them are encouraged by parents and caregivers as their small hands are more dexterous than adults.</p>

            <p>The effects are worsened on children still in the womb, with still and premature births and low birth weights and lengths. These children are also at higher risk of cognitive disabilities, reduced neonatal behavioural neurological assessment scores, higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioural problems, reduced cognitive and language scores and more.</p>

            <p>Mismanaged e-waste slowly comes back to us in our food, our water, and our air. Instead, we should focus on reducing it and recycling it safely. </p>
