        <p class="children-text">For a child, e-waste can change lung function, respiratory and respiratory effects and increases the risk of chronic diseases later in life, like cancer and cardiovascular disease. 12.9 million women are potentially exposed to toxic e-waste, working in the informal waste sector putting them and their unborn children at risk.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="children-text">The effects are worsened on children still in the womb, with still and premature births and low birth weights and lengths. These children are also at higher risk of cognitive disabilities, reduced neonatal behavioural neurological assessment scores, higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioural problems, reduced cognitive and language scores and more.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="children-text">Mismanaged e-waste slowly comes back to us in our food, our water, and our air. Instead, we should focus on reducing it and recycling it safely. </p>
