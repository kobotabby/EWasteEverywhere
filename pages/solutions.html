          <h1>Reduce</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>The first and simplest way to help with the ever increasing e-waste problem is to produce less. Companies constantly roll out new produces with new features encouraging shorter and shorter consumer and product lifespans. Instead of repeating the trend of buying and buying again, just run your current setup until it becomes obsolete in both hardware and software. The chances from the next new drop are that you probably don't need the new features as most modern phones are overkill on features like high refresh rates, quad camera setups and foldable screens that you can go without. Modern phones should easily run well for 3-4 years if not more. If it still works why replace it? Another way to reduce e-waste is to look for environmentally friendly products such as those labeled Energy Star or are certified by the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).</p>

            <h1>Reuse</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Find another purpose for your old electronics, even if they no longer have one to you. This can be through regifting, selling, donating it. Some devices you can even scavenge for valuable parts yourself and then remove them from your life. For example, performing surgery on your old computer to use it's compatible RAM sticks with your new one. If it's not compatible you can always try selling it bit by bit and you can follow along for steps to responsibly throw out the rest.</p>

            <h1>Repair</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>What if the electronic device could still be usable? Embrace the DIY mindset or fork out some side cash to get that veteran device working again. You can use online resources like iFixit to direct you through this. Turn the electronic's malfunction into your science experiment, you will most likely learn something new if not acquire a skill for next repair. </p>
